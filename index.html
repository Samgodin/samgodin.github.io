	<p>From a wheel, to a car, it has always been the case that humans find a way to increase efficiency/productivity.  A result of this increase in efficiency is a change in labor.  Labor innovation can help streamline a process, and make existing jobs easier, however it can also eliminate the need for certain jobs all together.  Socially, we sensationalize this so called advancement.  Smart electronics have been steadily increasing in sales since the early 2000s.  A smartphone takes the functions of many gadgets and combines them into one sleek device resulting in the original devices’ obsolescence.  Now imagine that the obsolete devices are jobs operated by humans…  If technology allows for these jobs to be turned into one or even no job, what happens?
In a discussion paper series published by IZA Institute of Labor Economics, and titled Technological Change and Employment: Were Ricardo and Marx Right? Authors, Mariacristina Piva and Marco Vivarelli discuss our technological innovation and break down differences between process innovation and product innovation.  Product innovation is (but is not limited to) creating a new product that provides the consumer with a desired service, made possible by technological advancement.  Product innovation often times leads to the creation of new jobs, as these products go into production.  Process innovation is exactly what it sounds like; it is innovation that streamlines a process making it better.  Better is of course subjective, as the result of innovative processes will affect the employee and the employer in dramatically different ways.  It is the blue-collar worker’s perspective that innovation will result in their ultimate dismissal, while cutting costs and improving production for the higher ups.
Also discussed in this text, are some different theories from economists surrounding automation and innovation.  The “Compensation Theory” involves different mechanisms that keep the production job market more or less cyclical in reference to process innovation.  One example is, when a production job is automated, a new job has to be created to manufacture the machinery required for its automation.  Similarly, when looking at product innovation– jobs lost as production slows on products that are not at peak innovation, become new jobs in production for the most innovative products.   
	A good example is the ATM, or Automated Teller Machine.  ATMs have almost entirely taken the place of human bank tellers in the United States.  This automation speeds up the services provided by the bank, and allows for more people to be serviced at one time. Although the bank teller jobs no longer exist, new jobs are created.  The ATM has to go into production, and after that, someone has to program these machines and perform maintenance when there are malfunctions.
This theory is flawed.  What the “Compensation Theory” doesn’t take into account are the different types of education required to perform in these new jobs.  It is unrealistic to expect someone to obtain an entirely new skill set for work.  It also doesn’t take into account the change in location of the job.  Production might take place in a completely different country than where the initial job was lost.  Even if the worker managed to obtain the skill set necessary to perform, and the production was not relocated, this job would still only last as long as the product needed to be produced.
	There are instances where process innovation and product innovation collide, for example, the self-driving car.  To a taxi company, this might seem like an effective way to cut costs, but there is a risk when you rely on a product to function as intended without human input.  Uber is a popular car service that uses a phone app to request a car, and set pick up and drop off locations.  In early 2017, Uber introduced a self-driving car.  These vehicles were not used in regular service at the time, but months later; they began to appear on the road in certain cities around the country.  Although these vehicles were fully operational without any human presence, there were still people in the driver seats to make sure that the trip was smooth.  These automated vehicles were in use for over five months with only minor conflict before March of 2018 when a pedestrian was struck and killed by a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona. The woman was walking her bike across the street when the car hit her, moving approximately 40 miles per hour.  There was a “human safety driver” at the wheel, but the car was in fully automatic function. In an article from The New York Times, it states that the Uber employee sitting in the driver’s seat was not paying attention when the car moved around a bend and struck the pedestrian.
The article has two videos embedded within, one of which shows the driver looking down to the right side of the wheel at what is assumed to be a phone, and the other video is from a dashboard camera that shows the car driving, leading up to the collision.  There is a lot of controversy around this event.  The safety drivers are instructed to sit with their hands hovering over the wheel in case of an emergency; however, the cars themselves are equipped with a “lidar” system that is supposed to detect the cars surroundings and send instructional signals to inform driving patterns.  
	This is a tragic event and although this occurrence is statistically improbable because of the technologies developed, it obviously can happen.  Self-operating machinery comes with an obvious risk, however to play devil’s advocate, there are endless potentials for systems that implement this automation in a way that could benefit our lives.  Imagine a city with a transportation system comprised of only electric powered, self-driving vehicles.  The cars could charge on a cycle and send information constantly to a central source.  This could result in little to no traffic, and an enormous decrease in pollution caused by non-electric vehicles.
	Historically, as jobs become obsolete, new jobs are created…  Ultimately this improves our perceived quality of life by providing us with more than what was originally available.  (The original service does not go away, it just exists without human operation.)  The issue we face now is that jobs aren’t being created fast enough to compensate for the jobs being automated.
Universal Basic Income is a system that would guarantee a set income to every citizen.  This income would be small, but enough to cushion, or enable self-care.  In a text titled Creative citizen, creative state: the principled and pragmatic case for a Universal Basic Income, authors Anthony Painter and Chris Thoung make a claim that universal basic income is possible in the UK.  This text is in favor of UBI, however it does not shy away from discussing the potential difficulties that lay in the way of this systems implementation.  They start off talking about the welfare system…  The welfare system’s goal is to provide equity in different groups of people, whether it is people with a disability, people over a certain age, or people living in poverty, etc.  The idea behind this system is without a doubt positive, but there have been strict laws put in place, that often make it hard to be a part of it.  People who do not qualify sneak in, and people who should be qualified are denied.  A universal basic income would raise the economic floor and supply people with enough to live.
Most fascinating in this text was a discussion about the potential enhancement of the lives of youth because of a monetary cushion.  Focus and energy could be applied more directly to finding out and perusing things that are of interest rather than settling into a system to be safe.   This made me think of an article written by David Graeber on “Pointless Jobs.” In the article, Graeber argues that the number of “pointless jobs” is increasing.  Jobs that could easily be taken over by AI (Artificial Intelligence) are left in the hands of humans that are often less efficient in the role than a robot would be.  This happens as a result of capitalism.  The distribution of wealth in the power structure of a company often times provides blue-collar employees with the least while someone higher up in the ladder gets paid more for doing something that could be automated.  For example, a custodian gets paid less than someone in an administrative role, even though the administrative position is based on a formula that could be processed by a computer. 
	In another article written about David Graeber, by Stuart Jeffries, some the many ways people might be wasting time are discussed.  He begins talking about Graebers mother, and David’s failed attempt at getting her Medicaid.  He was unable to receive Medicaid before the death of his mother because of small human errors such as the misspelling of a name.  This leads to questioning the amount of time we spend doing things like meaningless paperwork.  Jeffries writes that David was eight years old when the Apollo moon landing happened, and at that time, he was fascinated thinking about what the world would look like when he was 39 in the year 2000.  The article wraps up with David talking about our inherent playful nature as humans.  We feel a need to conform to a system that prohibits fun and freedom. 
	What would happen if we continued to automate jobs and didn’t worry about how we were going to compensate?  What would happen if we thought about the jobs that need to exist for the sustainability of our planet, or even just to sustain our own mental/physical health?
If a Universal Basic Income becomes a reality, possibilities for employment that are unimaginable right now might present themselves.
